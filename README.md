# HTH 2024 Terminator Village & Talk

For the Hackers Teaching Hackers conference in 2024, I ran a village called **"Come With Me if You Want to Lab"** as the conference theme was Terminator.

I also gave an updated version of my talk, **"Building a Detection Engineering Home Lab"** at the conference and I have the updated slides as part of this repo. I also added a copy of the slides from my talk about building home labs in general from a couple years ago per the request of someone at the conference.

The site for the village, and location of the slide decks, is here: https://lexcilius.github.io/hth2024labbing/
