        <h1>Lab 1</h1>
        <h2>Scenario Overview</h2>
        <p>The industrial control system (ICS) used in this scenario  simulates an environment that might be used to cool industrial equipment. The  ICS is made up of five systems. The first system contains a tank, tank level sensor  and a water pump. The second system is a programmable logic controller (PLC)  which controls the water pump based on the level of water found in the attached  tank. The third system is an Open Platform Communications (OPC) server which accesses  and modifies data found on the PLC. The fourth system is running Human Machine Interface  (HMI) software which communicates with the OPC server to provide a human system  operator with system statistics and control. The final system in the ICS is a security  appliance that provides routing and firewall services for all systems.
        This scenario also make use of a system running Kali Linux. In this lab the virtual network switch is configured so that the Kail system receives all data transmitted. (<a href="reference/Visio-ZoneingAndICSSecurity-Insecure.pdf" target="_blank" title="Graphical network diagram">Network diagram</a>)</p>
        <p>In this lab you are going to observe that when a hacker is  connected to the same network segment as the ICS systems, they are easily able  to view data being shared between all devices. After verifying this you will  move the hacker system to its own network and again attempt to view data being transferred.  You will discover that when a hacker is connected to a different segment then  the ICS systems they are no longer able to view data transfers.</p>
        
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <p><strong>Install and Configure Systems</strong></p>
        <p>In this part of the lab you are going to install and configure the systems needed to complete the lab. </p>
        <ol>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> If necessary, install the free <a href="https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html" target="_blank">Oracle VirtualBox Manager</a> software on your system.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Download, and if necessary extract, the lab image <a href="https://www.nl.northweststate.edu/CAMO/software/VirtualMachine/VirtualBox/ICS-VirtualBox.ova">ICS-VirtualBox.ova</a>.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Start the <span class="quote">Oracle VM VirtualBox</span> program.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Import the<span class="quote"> ICS-VirtualBox.ova</span> lab image.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> After the import has completed access the <span class="quote">Settings</span> for the <span class="quote">Security Appliance</span> virtual machine and change its configuration so that it is bridged to the network device in your host computer.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Power on the systems in the following order:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Appliance</strong> [Username: <code>admin</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor</strong> [Username: <code>root</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
                <li><strong>PLC</strong> [Username: <code>root</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
                <li><strong>OPC</strong> [Username: <code>student</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
                <li><strong>HMI</strong> [Username: <code>student</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
                <li><strong>Kali</strong> [Username: <code>student</code> Password: <code>Password01</code>]</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <p><strong>Login and verify connectivity</strong></p>
        <p>In this part of the lab you are going to login to the hacker system, view the system's IP address and verify that it can connect to the PLC.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Access the <span class="quote">Kali</span> system.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> At the login screen enter <span class="typed">student</span> into the <span class="quote">Enter your username</span> field and <span class="typed">Password01</span> into the <span class="quote">Enter your password</span> field.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Click the <span class="button">Log In</span> button.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Open a terminal (command prompt) window by clicking the <span class="typed">Terminal Emulator</span> button found at the upper left hand corner of the window (<a href="../images/Part3-1.png" target="_blank" title="Graphic showing location of screen element">Example</a>).</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> View the network address of the system by typing the command <span class="typed">ip address show</span> (NOTE: You must press the <span class="typed">&lt;ENTER&gt;</span> key after typing a command). </li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Examine the output of the command and find the IPv4 address associated with the active network card viewing the <span class="quote">inet</span> value associated with the network card labeled <span class="quote">cell-area-zone</span> (<a href="../images/Part3-2.png" target="_blank" title="Graphic showing location of screen element">Example</a>).
            <ul>
              <li>Notice that the system contains multiple network cards. Network card <span class="quote">1:</span> labeled <span class="quote">lo:</span> is the loopback card which is used for internal communications and testing, network card <span class="quote">2:</span> labeled <span class="quote">cell-area-zone:</span> is the card connected to the Cell/Area zone along with the ICS systems, network card <span class="quote">3:</span> labeled <span class="quote">manufact-zone</span> is currently disabled (DOWN) and is connected to the Manufacturing zone network segment which is separated from the ICS systems by a router/firewall.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Verify that the hacker can communicate with the PLC by typing the command <span class="typed">ping 10.0.255.102 -c 4</span> and observing that 4 packets are transmitted and 4 packets are received.</li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Verify that the PLC is running by typing the command<span class="typed"> nc 10.0.255.102 23</span> and observing that the PLC is running, and that the IP address of the PLC and the address of the connecting system is shown.  
          <ul>
            <li>The <span class="quote">nc</span> command starts the <span class="quote">netcat</span> program which is a useful network utility that allows a quick connection to network services. In this case <span class="quote">netcat</span> is connecting to the <span class="quote">telnet</span> service running on the PLC.</li>
            <li>Note that theÂ KaliÂ system is on the same IP  network (10.0.255.0/24) as the ICS systems (10.0.255.0/24).</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Part 3</h3>
        <p><strong>Capture and view data transmitted in the Cell-Area zone</strong></p>
        <p>In this part of the lab you are going to use the Wireshark network monitoring software to capture and view data being transmitted on the Cell-Area zone.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Start the Wireshark program by typing the command <span class="typed">sudo wireshark</span>.  
          <ul>
            <li>The Wireshark program requires administrative privileges to the system, since you are currently logged in as the student user you must indicate that you wish to use administrative privileges prefixing the command to be executed with sudo.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><input type="checkbox"> Authenticate to the system by typing in the password <span class="typed">Password01</span> followed by the <span class="typed">&lt;ENTER&gt;</span> key.

          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><input type="checkbox">After the Wireshark program starts select the <span class="quote">cell-area-zone</span> network device to indicate that you wish to capture data on that device.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Part 4</h3> 
        <p><strong>Change the hacker's network segment</strong></p>
        <p>In this part of the lab you are going to remove the hacker from the network containing the ICS systems.
